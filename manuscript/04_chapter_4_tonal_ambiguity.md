# Chapter 4: Tonal Ambiguity & Fluctuation
## Beyond the Scale: Creating Dreamscapes and Mystery

While the Royal Road provides the anthem of the hero, the "Japanese Sound" also excels at the opposite: the feeling of being lost in a magical forest, an alien world, or a complex emotional memory. This is achieved through tonal ambiguity.

> **The Composer’s Path: Emotional Mapping**
>
> **Quartal Harmony:** "Ancient Mystery" or "The Blank Slate."
> **The Feeling:** Stacked fourths create a sound that feels "open" and unmoored from the gravity of Major/Minor keys. It is the sound of a protagonist waking up with amnesia or entering a sanctuary.
>
> **Chromatic Mediants:** "Dream Logic" or "Magical Dislocation."
> **The Feeling:** Shifting between chords that share one note but belong to distant keys (like C Major to E Major). It creates a "sparkle" or a sudden shift in perspective, mimicking the logic of a dream or a portal opening.

### 4.1 Key Fluctuation: The Chino Method

One of the most defining characteristics of Japanese harmony, as codified by theorists like Kayano Chino (Chino, 2025), is **Key Fluctuation (Key Tensei)** and **Multipolar Tonality**.

*   **Concept:** Instead of firmly establishing and remaining within a single key, JRPG music often oscillates or drifts between tonal centers that, to a Western ear, might sound distant or unrelated. These "polar keys" often share little in common functionally.
*   **Chromatic Mediants:** A common manifestation of this is the use of **Chromatic Mediant** relationships. For example, a track might move seamlessly from C Major to E Major, or from F# Minor to A Minor. In Western theory, these shifts require complex modulatory passages. In JRPG music, they can happen almost abruptly, creating a sense of wonder, dislocation, or magical transition.
*   **The Effect:** This constant, subtle shifting prevents the music from feeling "grounded." It creates a sense of perpetual motion and emotional ambiguity—a dreamlike quality where the rules of gravity don't quite apply. This is perfect for fantasy worlds where unexpected events are the norm.

### 4.2 Quartal Harmony: The Open Sound of Fantasy

While Chapter 3 explored tertian (third-based) harmony, much of the ethereal and grand sound of JRPG soundtracks, especially those by **Yasunori Mitsuda** (*Chrono Trigger*), comes from **Quartal Harmony**.

*   **Definition:** Instead of stacking notes in thirds (e.g., C-E-G for C Major), quartal harmony stacks them in perfect or augmented fourths (e.g., C-F-Bb, or C-F#-B).
*   **The "Sus4" Sound:** A simple but powerful application is the **Sus4 (Suspended 4th) chord**. Instead of a 3rd, it uses a 4th above the root (e.g., C-F-G). This creates an ambiguous, "open" sound that is neither strictly major nor minor. It implies possibility, often used in intros or when a character is contemplating a journey (Mitsuda, 2025).
*   **Why it Works for Games:**
    1.  **Ambiguity:** The lack of a clear major/minor quality makes it suitable for diverse emotional contexts in games.
    2.  **Hardware Efficiency:** Crucially, quartal chords are often more acoustically clean on limited-voice hardware. When you stack many thirds on a 3-channel chip, the complex overtones can clash and create a "muddy" or "beating" sound. Stacking perfect fourths and fifths results in fewer clashing overtones, allowing composers to create "bigger," clearer sounds with fewer voices (Quartal Harmony, 2025).

### 4.3 Practical Application: Composing with Ambiguity

Integrating tonal ambiguity and quartal harmony into your compositions requires a shift in mindset:

1.  **Embrace the "Pivot":** Don't be afraid to jump between seemingly unrelated keys. Try moving up or down a Major or Minor 3rd from your current key. For example, if you're in C Major, try abruptly shifting to Eb Major or A Major. Use a common chord (e.g., the V or vii) as a brief bridge, or no bridge at all.
2.  **Stack Fourths:** Experiment with building chords entirely in fourths.
    *   Try a simple two-note voicing like `C-F` or `D-G`.
    *   Extend it: `C-F-Bb`, `C-F-Bb-Eb`. These create rich, ethereal pads.
    *   Use the Sus4 liberally: Replace standard major or minor chords with their Sus4 counterparts to create tension and openness.
3.  **Tonal Maps vs. Linear Progressions:** Instead of thinking of music as a linear journey from "home" to "destination," imagine it as a map where you can take different paths between emotional "locations." This aligns with the non-linear nature of exploration in many JRPGs.

By consciously employing these techniques, you can move beyond Western harmonic conventions and tap into the unique emotional palette that defines the most iconic JRPG soundtracks.
