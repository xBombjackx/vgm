# Chapter 10: Arcade Masters
## YM2151, Sega's System 16, and the Coin-Op Evolution

While home consoles fought for dominance in the living room, the true cutting edge of audio technology was found in the noisy, smoke-filled arcades of the 1980s. Arcade boards were expensive, powerful, and often custom-built. They didn't have to worry about consumer price points, allowing engineers to pack them with superior synthesis chips.

For the chiptune producer, understanding arcade hardware is understanding the "Pro" version of the 16-bit sound. It’s the difference between a garage band (Genesis) and a studio session (Arcade).

### 10.1 The Yamaha YM2151 (OPM)

If the YM2612 (Genesis) was the gritty rock star, the **YM2151 (OPM)** was the polished jazz fusion artist. Used in countless boards from Sega (System 16), Capcom (CPS-1), and Konami, it was the de-facto standard for '80s arcade sound.
*   **8 Channels of FM:** Two more than the Genesis.
*   **Cleaner DAC:** The YM2151 was typically paired with a dedicated, high-quality DAC (like the YM3012). It lacked the "Ladder Effect" distortion of the Genesis.
*   **The Sound:** Crystal clear electric pianos, sharp metallic basses, and shimmering bells. This is the sound of *Street Fighter II*, *OutRun*, and *Marble Madness*.

### 10.2 Sega System 16: The "Super Scaler" Sound

Sega's System 16 arcade board (and its siblings like the "Super Scaler" boards for *Space Harrier* and *After Burner*) defined the "Blue Sky" Sega sound.
*   **PCM Samples:** In addition to the YM2151, these boards often used dedicated PCM chips for high-quality drums and orchestral hits (often the Sega PCM chip).
*   **The Aesthetic:** High-speed jazz fusion. The clarity of the YM2151 allowed for complex, fast-moving basslines and solos that wouldn't turn into mud.

### 10.3 Practical Resurrection: The Arcade Polish

Recreating the arcade sound means cleaning up your act.

#### **Tools:**
*   **VOPM (Free VST):** A classic, reliable emulation of the YM2151.
*   **Plogue Chipsynth OPS7:** While modeled on the DX7 (6-op), it can cleanly replicate the 4-op structure of the OPM with pristine fidelity.
*   **Furnace Tracker:** Supports YM2151 natively.

#### **Technique: Stereo Panning & LFO**
The YM2151 had robust stereo panning capabilities.
*   **The "Flyby":** Automate the panning of your lead synth to simulate the movement of a car or jet, paying homage to the "Super Scaler" games.
*   **Vibrato:** Use the chip's LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator) generously on leads to mimic the expressive playing of a fusion guitarist.
