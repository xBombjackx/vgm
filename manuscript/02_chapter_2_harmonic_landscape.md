# Chapter 2: The Harmonic Landscape of Japan
## Impressionism, Fusion, and the "City Pop" Trojan Horse

To understand why Japanese game music sounds distinct from its Western counterparts, one must look beyond the console and into the conservatory. While Western game music of the 1980s was frequently defined by the technical virtuosity of **Progressive Rock** and the high-speed arpeggiation of the demoscene—pioneered by figures like **Tim Follin** and **Rob Hubbard**—their Japanese peers were operating under a distinct musical paradigm: **Jazz Fusion**. This was not a contrast of "simple" versus "complex," but rather a divergence in harmonic philosophy.

The "Japanese Sound" is not an accident of hardware; it is the result of a specific musicological lineage that runs from the halls of French Impressionism through the neon-lit jazz clubs of 1970s Tokyo, finally embedding itself in the silicon of the Famicom. For the modern producer, realizing this sound means unlearning the reliance on the "Power Chord" (Root-Fifth) and embracing the emotional ambiguity of **Extended Harmony**.

### 2.1 The Academic Foundation: Debussy in the Data

While the Western chiptune scene often drew from the "bedroom coder" tradition of self-taught virtuosos, music education in post-war Japan was rigorous and heavily standardized, with a curriculum that prioritized European Classical theory. However, it was not the Germanic dominance of Beethoven or Bach that resonated most deeply with the modern Japanese sensibility, but the French Impressionism of **Claude Debussy** and **Maurice Ravel**.

Impressionism offered a harmonic language based on **color** rather than strict functional resolution. Techniques like *planing* (moving a chord shape in parallel up and down a scale) and the use of *non-functional* Major 7th chords created distinct atmospheres—water, wind, machinery—without needing a traditional melody.

When early game composers like **Koichi Sugiyama** (*Dragon Quest*) approached the NES, they treated the 3-voice limit not as a restriction, but as a challenge in **Counterpoint**. Sugiyama, a classically trained TV composer, applied strict Baroque and Impressionist rules to the bleeps and bloops. This provided a counterpoint to the Western "Prog" approach; where Western composers used complex meters and timbral shifts to elevate the medium, Sugiyama and his peers used harmonic color and structural rigor to grant it a sense of "High Art" legitimacy (Sugiyama, 2025).

### 2.2 The Fusion Explosion: Casiopea and T-Square

If Impressionism provided the academic skeleton, **Jazz Fusion** provided the blood and muscle.

In the late 1970s and early '80s, Japan experienced a fusion boom led by two titan bands: **Casiopea** and **T-Square**. These groups blended the complexity of jazz harmony with the high-energy rhythms of funk and the melodic clarity of pop music. Their influence on the game industry was total.

*   **Koji Kondo** (*Super Mario Bros., Legend of Zelda*) has explicitly cited Casiopea as a primary influence. The iconic "underground" theme in Mario is effectively a fusion bassline.
*   **The "Mint Jams" Aesthetic:** The clean, chorus-drenched guitar tones and slap bass of Casiopea’s seminal live album *Mint Jams* (1982) became the sonic template for the 16-bit era (Anatone, 2025).

For the producer, this means the "Game Music" genre is actually a sub-genre of Jazz Fusion. The driving 16th-note hi-hats, the syncopated basslines, and the active chord changes are all tropes lifted directly from the fusion playbook.

### 2.3 The "Extended" Chord as Default

A definable characteristic of this style is its frequent move beyond the simple Triad (Root-3rd-5th). In the harmonic language of J-Pop and Fusion, a chord is rarely considered "complete" without the **7th** or the **9th**.

*   **The Major 7th (IV∆7):** In Western rock, a Major chord is stable. In Japanese Fusion, the *Major 7th* is the default home. It adds a layer of "wistfulness" or "nostalgia" that prevents the music from feeling too settled.
*   **The Sus4 Chord:** Heavily used by **Yasunori Mitsuda** (*Chrono Trigger*), the Suspended 4th chord creates an "open" sound that implies vastness. It is neither major nor minor, making it perfect for the "blank slate" of a protagonist starting an adventure (Mitsuda, 2025).

### 2.4 Cultural Context: Technological Optimism

This musical complexity mirrored the economic reality of Japan in the 1980s. The "Bubble Economy" was at its peak. Tokyo was a city of neon, Walkmans, and high-speed trains. The music of the era—dubbed **"City Pop"**—reflected this technological optimism. It was bright, sophisticated, and hyper-competent.

Video games were the ultimate export of this high-tech culture. Therefore, the music *had* to match. It couldn't sound gritty or "underground" like the American arcade scene; it had to sound sparkling and futuristic. This is why the Yamaha YM2612 on the Sega Genesis, despite its ability to make grimy noises, was often programmed to sound like a glistening electric piano or a slap bass—it was emulating the aspirational sound of the Tokyo skyline.

### 2.5 Practical Application: The Arpeggio Necessity

This harmonic ambition clashed violently with the hardware reality. How do you play a **C Major 9th chord** (C - E - G - B - D) which requires 5 notes, on a NES that only has 3 melodic channels?

The answer became the defining technique of chiptune: ** The Fast Arpeggio**.

Composers would program a single channel to cycle through the notes of the extended chord at high speeds (often 1 frame per note, or 60Hz). To the human ear, this blurred into a single "wobbly" chord. What began as a technical hack to emulate Casiopea’s keyboard players became a genre-defining aesthetic.

### 2.6 Melodic Tropes: The Geometry of the Lead Line

Beyond harmony, the "Composer’s Path" relies on specific melodic shapes to communicate setting and energy.

#### **1. The Pentatonic Shorthand (Eastern Flavors)**
When a player enters a "Japanese-style" village or a mountain shrine in a JRPG, the music immediately pivots to **Pentatonic scales**.
*   **The Trope:** Using the **Yo scale** (Major Pentatonic) or the **In scale** (which includes semitones like E-F and B-C).
*   **The Effect:** These scales bypass the "Western" feel of the Major/Minor system, instantly evoking a sense of ancient tradition or cultural "otherness" within the high-tech digital environment.

#### **2. Call and Response (The Fusion Battle Logic)**
In battle themes—where energy is paramount—composers often abandon long, flowing melodies in favor of **Call and Response**.
*   **The Trope:** Drawing directly from Jazz Fusion, a "lead" instrument (Pulse 1) will play a short, aggressive phrase, which is immediately "answered" by the bassline (Triangle) or a secondary counter-melody (Pulse 2).
*   **The Effect:** This creates a sense of frantic dialogue and "musical combat," perfectly matching the turn-based or real-time action on screen.

### 2.7 Further Listening: The J-Fusion Syllabus

To truly internalize this harmonic language, one must go to the source. The following tracks offer a direct sonic lineage to the Golden Age of game music.

*   **The Track:** *Casiopea - "Asayake" (1979)*
    *   **The Game Equivalent:** *Super Mario Kart - "Rainbow Road"*
    *   **The Connection:** The quintessential "optimistic fusion" anthem. Note the relentless 16th-note rhythm guitar ("cutting") and the bright, brassy synthesizer leads that became the default for Nintendo's racing games.

*   **The Track:** *T-Square - "Truth" (1987)*
    *   **The Game Equivalent:** *F-Zero - "Big Blue"*
    *   **The Connection:** This track, the theme for Japan's F1 Grand Prix, defined the "High-Speed Rock Fusion" style. The electric wind instrument (EWI) melody directly parallels the piercing lead lines used to cut through the engine noise in *F-Zero*.

*   **The Track:** *Tatsuro Yamashita - "Sparkle" (1982)*
    *   **The Game Equivalent:** *Sonic the Hedgehog - "Green Hill Zone"*
    *   **The Connection:** While Masato Nakamura (Dreams Come True) composed Sonic, the DNA of *Green Hill Zone* is pure City Pop. Listen for the clean, chorus-heavy guitar stabs and the walking bassline that emphasizes the "cool" over the "epic."

*   **The Track:** *Yellow Magic Orchestra - "Rydeen" (1979)*
    *   **The Game Equivalent:** *Super Mario Bros. - "Underground Theme"*
    *   **The Connection:** YMO is the bridge between Kraftwerk and J-Pop. The sparse, strictly quantized basslines and tight melodic loops heavily influenced Koji Kondo’s minimalist approach to early NES limitations.
