# Chapter 3: The Royal Road (Ōdō Shinkō)
## The Harmonic Heart of the Japanese Hero

If there is one sequence of chords that defines the "Japanese Sound," it is the Royal Road. But to the composer, it is more than just a sequence of Roman numerals; it is a structural representation of a specific emotional state.

> **The Composer’s Path: Emotional Mapping**
>
> **The Mood:** "Heroic Longing" or "The Boundless Horizon."
>
> **The Feeling:** That specific sensation of standing at the edge of a vast world map for the first time. It is optimistic, but carries a faint weight of nostalgia—the feeling that the journey will be long and the stakes are high.
>
> **Why it works:** By starting on the **IV chord** (the Subdominant) instead of the **I chord** (the Tonic), the music feels like it is "already in motion." It creates a sense of forward momentum that never quite feels "finished," making it perfect for the infinite loops of an RPG overworld.
>
> **Artist Tip:** To create the "Wistful" feeling of a 90s RPG ending, start your progression on the IV∆7 chord but keep the melody focused on the 7th and 9th intervals of the scale. This prevents the melody from feeling too "resolved," capturing that bittersweet sense of a journey concluding.

### 3.1 Theory Deep Dive: The IV∆7 – V7 – iii7 – vi Progression

The progression in the key of C Major is: **FMaj7 – G7 – Emin7 – Amin**.

To understand why this works, we must analyze the functional harmony of each step.

#### **Step 1: The Lift (IV∆7 / Subdominant)**
Western pop often starts on the **Tonic (I)**, establishing a firm "ground." The Royal Road, however, begins on the **Subdominant (IV)**. This creates an immediate sense of "lift" or departure. It is the musical equivalent of stepping out the front door. The use of the **Major 7th** here is crucial—it adds a bittersweet texture to the optimism.

#### **Step 2: The Climb (V7 / Dominant)**
From the IV, we move up to the **Dominant (V)**. In traditional theory, the V chord screams for resolution back to the I (Home). It creates maximum tension and forward momentum.

#### **Step 3: The Detour (iii7 / Mediant)**
**This is the magic trick.** Instead of resolving the tension of the V chord to the stable I (C Major), the Royal Road resolves deceptively to the **Mediant (iii)**.
*   The **iii (Em)** is the "relative minor" of the Dominant, but it shares two notes with the Tonic (E and G).
*   **The Effect:** It provides a *soft* resolution. It feels like "home," but a version of home that is sadder, older, or further away. This is the source of the "Nostalgia" or "Heroic Longing" often cited by fans of the genre. It satisfies the ear’s need for stability without stopping the momentum (HueSteus, 2022).

#### **Step 4: The Landing (vi / Submediant)**
Finally, the progression falls to the **Submediant (vi)**. This provides a temporary minor-key stability, setting the stage to jump right back to the IV and start the cycle again.

### 3.2 The Infinite Loop Mechanics

Why is this progression perfect for video games? **Because it avoids the Tonic (I).**

Video game music (BGM) must loop for hours without annoying the player.
*   **The Western Trap:** A progression that resolves strongly to I (like V-I) feels like a "Period" at the end of a sentence. Repeat it 100 times, and it becomes repetitive.
*   **The Japanese Solution:** The Royal Road feels like a "Comma." By avoiding the definitive resolution of the Tonic, the music remains in a state of suspended animation. It is a "Shepard Tone" of emotion—constantly rising, never landing. This propels the player forward, subconsciously suggesting that there is always more to explore (Ong, 2025).

### 3.3 The "Komuro" Variation: The Sound of Tragedy

While the Royal Road is the sound of *Adventure*, its darker cousin is the **Komuro Progression**, named after legendary producer Tetsuya Komuro (TM Network).

The sequence is: **vi – IV – V – I**.
(In C Major: **Am – F – G – C**)

*   **The Vibe:** By starting on the Minor **vi**, it establishes a melancholic or "cool" tone immediately.
*   **The Resolution:** Unlike the Royal Road, this *does* resolve to the I at the end. This gives it a sense of tragic finality.
*   **Usage:** You will hear this in "Town Themes" where a tragedy has occurred, or in the introspective verses of J-Pop ballads before they explode into a Royal Road chorus (Madden, 2025).

### 3.4 Practical Resurrection: Writing the Road

To use this in a modern production without it sounding like a caricature, focus on **Voice Leading**.

1.  **7ths are Mandatory:** A plain F Major triad sounds like a nursery rhyme. An **FMaj7** sounds like Studio Ghibli.
2.  **Keep Common Tones:** When moving from **FMaj7** (F-A-C-E) to **G7** (G-B-D-F), keep the notes smooth. Don't just jump the whole chord block up a whole step.
3.  **The "Walking Bass":** In the 16-bit era, composers often used a descending bassline under these chords to glue them together. Try moving the bass contrary to the melody.

### 3.5 Case Studies: The Road in Action

#### **Case Study A: The Archetype**
*   **Track:** "Overture" from *Dragon Quest*
*   **Composer:** Koichi Sugiyama
*   **Analysis:** This piece is the "Patient Zero" of the Royal Road in gaming. The opening fanfare establishes a triumphant G Major. When the main melody enters, it doesn't stay comfortable; it immediately leaps to the **IV∆7 (CMaj7)**.
*   **The Emotional Effect:** By starting the phrase on the "Lift" (IV), Sugiyama creates a sense of grand departure. It mimics the physical act of a hero stepping out of a castle gate onto a vast field. The resolution to the **iii (Bm)** prevents it from feeling too military or march-like; instead, it feels romantic and adventurous.

#### **Case Study B: The Loop**
*   **Track:** "Overworld Theme" from *Super Mario Bros.*
*   **Composer:** Koji Kondo
*   **Analysis:** While often analyzed as a Calypso or Latin rhythm, the harmonic engine is pure J-Fusion.
*   **The Technique:** Kondo uses a variation of the Royal Road logic. The B section of the theme swings comfortably between **Subdominant (IV)** and **Dominant (V)** functionality, avoiding the Tonic for long stretches.
*   **Why it Works:** This constant harmonic "hovering" is what allows the track to loop hundreds of times without annoying the player. It never fully "lands" until the player reaches the flag pole.

### **The Workshop: Walking the Road**

*   **Technical Challenge (Programmer):** In your tracker or DAW, program a 60Hz arpeggio command (0xy) to play a **Major 7th chord** on a single monophonic channel. This replicates the hardware "hack" used to play complex fusion chords on limited voices.
*   **Artistic Challenge (Composer):** **The Royal Loop.** Write an 8-bar loop using only the **IV∆7–V–iii–vi** progression. **Constraint:** The loop must repeat 10 times. You must vary the melody in each pass—moving from simple motifs to complex variations—to keep the listener engaged without ever changing the underlying chords. **The Vibe:** Write this for a hero looking out over a vast, unexplored continent from a high cliff.
