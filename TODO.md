# Project TODO List - Pixel & Progression

*(Formerly "Silicon Symphonies")*

This file tracks active tasks for the "Pixel & Progression" book project.

**Current Phase:** Content Polish & Visual Planning

## Phase 4: Final Manuscript Corrections (Critique Response)

- [x] **PC-98 Legacy (Chapter 5):** Add a sidebar acknowledging the NEC PC-9801/8801 lineage. Explain that the "Genesis FM" sound originated on Japanese computers (YM2203/YM2608). (Done)
- [x] **Nuance "West vs. East" (Chapter 1):** Add a disclaimer to the "Ludomusical Convergence" section. Explicitly state that the "Bedroom Coder vs. Corporate Team" binary is a heuristic, acknowledging exceptions (Japanese doujin scene, Western audio teams). (Done)
- [x] **De-Melodramatize Chapter 15:** Rewrite the introduction to remove "Old Man Yells at Cloud" tone. Reframe the transition from chips to CD as a "shift in abstraction" (Hardware -> Middleware) rather than a "loss of soul." (Done)
- [x] **MML Context (Chapter 12):** Add a sidebar/section "The Ghost in the Code: MML vs. Trackers." Clarify that while we teach Trackers, Japanese composers historically used Music Macro Language (text-based coding), which influenced their structural precision. (Done)
- [x] **Famicom Disk System (Chapter 7):** Add a section covering the FDS Wavetable channel. Position it as the "Missing Link" between the NES Pulse waves and the PC Engine's wavetable synthesis. (Done)
- [x] **N64 vs. PS1 (Chapter 15):** Add a specific mention of the Nintendo 64 (Reality Signal Processor) as the "Last Stand" of the sequenced/chip era, contrasting it with the Red Book audio of PlayStation/Saturn. (Done)

## Phase 3: Critical Fixes (Post-Review)

- [x] **Content Removal:** Delete the "Treasure / Dynamic Tile Loading" sidebar from Chapter 1. (Done)
- [x] **Bias Correction (Chapter 2):** Edit the "Western vs. Japanese" comparison to acknowledge Tim Follin/Prog Rock. (Done)
- [x] **Technical Precision (Chapter 8):** Change "a few frames" to "3-6 ticks" in the "Fake Echo" section. (Done)
- [x] **Pedagogical Expansion (Chapter 5):** Expand the "FM Algorithms" explanation with concrete examples. (Done)
- [x] **Structural Review:** Moved "Practical Resurrection" sections earlier in Chapters 5 and 6. Evaluation complete: Superior for engagement. (Done)
