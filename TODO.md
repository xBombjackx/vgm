# Project TODO List - Pixel & Progression

*(Formerly "Silicon Symphonies")*

This file tracks active tasks for the "Pixel & Progression" book project.

**Current Phase:** Content Polish & Visual Planning

## Phase 4: Final Manuscript Corrections (Critique Response)

- [x] **PC-98 Legacy (Chapter 5):** Add a sidebar acknowledging the NEC PC-9801/8801 lineage. Explain that the "Genesis FM" sound originated on Japanese computers (YM2203/YM2608). (Done)
- [x] **Nuance "West vs. East" (Chapter 1):** Add a disclaimer to the "Ludomusical Convergence" section. Explicitly state that the "Bedroom Coder vs. Corporate Team" binary is a heuristic, acknowledging exceptions (Japanese doujin scene, Western audio teams). (Done)
- [x] **De-Melodramatize Chapter 15:** Rewrite the introduction to remove "Old Man Yells at Cloud" tone. Reframe the transition from chips to CD as a "shift in abstraction" (Hardware -> Middleware) rather than a "loss of soul." (Done)
- [x] **MML Context (Chapter 12):** Add a sidebar/section "The Ghost in the Code: MML vs. Trackers." Clarify that while we teach Trackers, Japanese composers historically used Music Macro Language (text-based coding), which influenced their structural precision. (Done)
- [x] **Famicom Disk System (Chapter 7):** Add a section covering the FDS Wavetable channel. Position it as the "Missing Link" between the NES Pulse waves and the PC Engine's wavetable synthesis. (Done)
- [x] **N64 vs. PS1 (Chapter 15):** Add a specific mention of the Nintendo 64 (Reality Signal Processor) as the "Last Stand" of the sequenced/chip era, contrasting it with the Red Book audio of PlayStation/Saturn. (Done)

## Phase 3: Critical Fixes (Post-Review)

- [x] **Content Removal:** Delete the "Treasure / Dynamic Tile Loading" sidebar from Chapter 1. (Done)
- [x] **Bias Correction (Chapter 2):** Edit the "Western vs. Japanese" comparison to acknowledge Tim Follin/Prog Rock. (Done)
- [x] **Technical Precision (Chapter 8):** Change "a few frames" to "3-6 ticks" in the "Fake Echo" section. (Done)
- [x] **Pedagogical Expansion (Chapter 5):** Expand the "FM Algorithms" explanation with concrete examples. (Done)
- [x] **Structural Review:** Moved "Practical Resurrection" sections earlier in Chapters 5 and 6. Evaluation complete: Superior for engagement. (Done)

## Phase 2: Editorial & Refinement (Active)

### [NEW] The Workshop: The Programmer’s & Composer’s Path

*These prompts are to be integrated as "Workshop" sidebars at the end of each chapter, providing both a software execution hurdle (Programmer) and a compositional constraint (Composer).*

#### **Chapter 1: The Ludomusical Convergence**

- **Technical (Programmer):** Setup a "Hardware Limitation" template in your DAW: exactly 3 mono synth tracks and 1 noise channel. Use no external effects.
- **Artistic (Composer):** **The Minimalism Challenge.** Write a 15-second "Start Screen" theme. **Constraint:** You are limited to a 3-note melody. You must create interest through rhythm and pulse-width changes rather than new notes.

#### **Chapter 2: The Harmonic Landscape**

- **Technical (Programmer):** Load a "City Pop" loop into your DAW. Apply a bit-crusher and a steep high-cut filter at 10kHz to hear the "chip-ification" of a complex signal.
- **Artistic (Composer):** **The J-Harmony Prompt.** Write a 4-bar melody using the **Yo scale** (Major Pentatonic). **Constraint:** Support it with a bassline that strictly uses 16th-note syncopated "slap" patterns.

#### **Chapter 3: The Royal Road**

- **Technical (Programmer):** In your tracker or DAW, program a 60Hz arpeggio command (0xy) to play a Major 7th chord on a single monophonic channel.
- **Artistic (Composer):** **The Royal Loop.** Write an 8-bar loop using only the **IV∆7–V–iii–vi** progression. **Constraint:** The loop must repeat 10 times. You must vary the melody in each pass to keep the listener engaged.

#### **Chapter 4: Tonal Ambiguity**

- **Technical (Programmer):** Implement a "Common Tone Pivot" in your DAW to jump from C Major to E Major using the note **E** as the anchor.
- **Artistic (Composer):** **Quartal Atmosphere.** Compose a "Dungeon" theme. **Constraint:** You are forbidden from using standard Major or Minor triads. Every chord must be built using stacked 4ths.

#### **Chapter 5: The FM Alchemist**

- **Technical (Programmer):** Program a "Slap Bass" or "Metallic Bell" in an FM VST (like Genny) using Algorithm 4.
- **Artistic (Composer):** **Metallic Loneliness.** Compose a 30-second loop. **Constraint:** Use only two operators per channel. Focus on non-harmonic intervals to create an industrial, cold atmosphere.

#### **Chapter 6: The Sampled Symphony**

- **Technical (Programmer):** Apply a "Gaussian Muffle" to a high-quality sample: a 12dB/oct LPF at 8kHz and bit-depth reduction to 12-bit.
- **Artistic (Composer):** **The 64KB Squeeze.** Write a theme. **Constraint:** You are limited to 8 monophonic tracks and 1-second samples total. Use volume crossfading to simulate a long "pad" sound.

#### **Chapter 7: 8-Bit Foundations**

- **Technical (Programmer):** Create a bassline in a tracker using the Triangle channel. Use "Note Cuts" (off-beats) to create rhythm without volume envelopes.
- **Artistic (Composer):** **The Hero's Fanfare.** Write a 10-second opening. **Constraint:** Use only 2 Pulse channels. One must be a constant 12.5% duty cycle, the other must sweep between cycles.

#### **Chapter 8: The Game Boy**

- **Technical (Programmer):** "Draw" a custom 32-step waveform in a tracker (LSDj) or VST. Create a "Soft Flute" and a "Sharp Saw."
- **Artistic (Composer):** **Handheld Intimacy.** Write a track intended for headphones. **Constraint:** Use "Hard Panning" (100% Left/Right) to separate the Lead and Harmony voices.

#### **Chapter 9: Western Counterpoint**

- **Technical (Programmer):** Practice "Channel Multiplexing" in your DAW by alternating a Kick and a Bass note on the same MIDI track every 16th note.
- **Artistic (Composer):** **Texture over Melody.** Compose a 20-second loop. **Constraint:** The melody must stay on a single note; all movement must come from varying the pulse-width or filter cutoff.

#### **Chapter 10: Arcade Masters**

- **Technical (Programmer):** Use an LFO in your DAW to automate the stereo panning of a lead synth at 160BPM.
- **Artistic (Composer):** **The Neon Velocity.** Compose a high-speed "Arcade" loop. **Constraint:** The bassline must never stop playing 16th notes. Use bright FM bells for the lead.

#### **Chapter 11: The Wavetable Frontier**

- **Technical (Programmer):** Automate the "Wave Position" in a wavetable synth to create a "Brass Growl" that evolves over time.
- **Artistic (Composer):** **The Digital Organ.** Compose a lush texture. **Constraint:** You must use 5 channels of custom-drawn waveforms. Each channel must be tuned to a different octave to create a massive "Pipe Organ" sound.

#### **Chapter 12: Tracker Workflow**

- **Technical (Programmer):** Use the `047` (Arpeggio) and `3xx` (Portamento) commands in a tracker to create a "vocal-like" melodic phrase.
- **Artistic (Composer):** **Vertical Composition.** Write a funky loop. **Constraint:** You are forbidden from snapping notes to the grid. Use the **Note Delay (EDx)** command to create a manual swing.

#### **Chapter 13: DAW Hybrid Workflow**

- **Technical (Programmer):** Layer an 8-bit pulse wave VST under a high-fidelity instrument. Mix them into a single "Hybrid" channel.
- **Artistic (Composer):** **The Lo-Fi Texture.** Take a high-fidelity recording, degrade it into a "digital grit" pad, and compose a chill-out track around it.

#### **Chapter 14: Retro SFX**

- **Technical (Programmer):** Synthesize a "Jump" and an "Explosion" sound using only a Square wave, a Noise generator, and pitch envelopes.
- **Artistic (Composer):** **The Character's Voice.** Create three "Dialogue Bleeps." **Constraint:** One must sound **Joyful**, one **Angry**, and one **Confused**, using only pitch contour and speed.

#### **Chapter 15: Legacy**

- **Technical (Programmer):** A/B test an 8-bit synth against a modern one. Identify the "Missing Frequencies" and use an EQ to "Age" the modern synth.
- **Artistic (Composer):** **The Modern Ghost.** Compose a piece in your DAW. **Constraint:** Follow every hardware limitation of the 16-bit era (8 voices, low sample rates) but use modern high-fidelity reverb.
