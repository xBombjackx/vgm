# Editorial & Style Guide: Pixel & Progression

**Purpose:** This guide ensures consistency, clarity, and adherence to the "Accessible Academic" tone throughout the "Pixel & Progression" manuscript. All future edits and additions must conform to these rules.

## 1. Tone & Voice
*   **Accessible Academic:** Maintain a formal yet engaging tone. Avoid overly academic jargon without explanation. Address the "prosumer" audience directly.
*   **De-AI-ify Protocol:** Ensure writing sounds human, organic, and specific. Avoid common AI tropes (e.g., "In conclusion," excessive bullet points where prose fits better, overuse of transition words like "Furthermore"). Use concrete examples.

## 2. Capitalization & Terminology
*   **Music Theory Terms:**
    *   **Capitalize** "Major" and "Minor" when referring to specific chords or keys (e.g., C Major 7, A Minor).
    *   **Capitalize** specific intervals (e.g., "Perfect 5th," "Major 3rd").
    *   **Lowercase** generic uses (e.g., "major key," "minor chord").
*   **Genre Terms:**
    *   **Lowercase** "chiptune" (unless starting a sentence).
    *   **Lowercase** "demoscene" (unless starting a sentence).
    *   **Capitalize** "City Pop."
*   **Project Specific Terms:**
    *   **Capitalize** "Sound Programmer" (as an auteur role).
    *   **Capitalize** "Sound Team."
    *   **Capitalize** "Ladder Effect," "Gaussian Interpolation Filter," "Royal Road."
    *   **"Fakebit" Philosophy:** Capitalize.
    *   **"DMG-01"**: Use full model number.
*   **General Capitalization:** Follow standard English grammar rules.

## 3. Punctuation & Syntax
*   **Decade Apostrophes:** Use `'90s` (apostrophe *before* the numbers), not `90s`.
*   **Compound Adjectives:** Hyphenate compound adjectives preceding a noun (e.g., "low-pass filter," "bit-accurate emulation," "eight-bit era"). Do not hyphenate when the adjective follows the noun (e.g., "the filter is low pass").
*   **En-dashes:** Use en-dashes (`–`) for ranges (e.g., "1983–1996").
*   **Commas:** Use the Oxford comma in lists of three or more items.
*   **Clarity:** Prioritize clarity and conciseness. Avoid overly long or convoluted sentences.

## 4. Formatting
*   **Headers:** Use standard Markdown headers (`#`, `##`, `###`).
*   **Bold:** Use double asterisks (`**text**`) for bolding. Use for key terms, chapter titles, and specific names upon first mention.
*   **Code/Hexadecimal:** Use backticks (`` `text` ``) for inline code, hexadecimal values (e.g., `0xy`, `40`), and file names (e.g., `sonic2.vgm`).
*   **Lists:** Use asterisk (`*`) for unordered lists and numbers (`1.`) for ordered lists.

## 5. Citations & Bibliography (APA 7th Edition)
*   **In-text Citations:** Follow (Author, Year) format (e.g., `(Collins, 2008)`).
*   **Reference List:**
    *   Place at the end of each chapter (as per user preference, "Option A").
    *   Alphabetize entries by author's last name.
    *   Follow APA 7th Edition guidelines for journals, books, web pages, etc. (e.g., italicized titles, retrieved from URLs).

## 6. Content Integration
*   **"Listening Cues" & "Visual Placeholders":** Use specific Markdown comments (e.g., `<!-- LISTENING CUE: Streets of Rage 2, Go Straight -->`) for audio examples and `<!-- FIGURE 5.3: YM2612 Algorithm Chart -->` for diagrams.
*   **Resource Pack:** All external resources will be linked via the `reference/resource_wishlist.md` document.
