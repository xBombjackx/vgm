# Visual Asset Requirements for "Pixel & Progression"

To address reader feedback regarding the "Visual Deficiency" (see `reviews/sentiment_summary.md`), the following diagrams and screenshots are required to support the text.

## 1. Interface Screenshots (Modern Workflow)
*   **Furnace Tracker:**
    *   **The Matrix:** A high-resolution screenshot of the Pattern Editor showing the 4 main column types (Note, Instrument, Volume, Effect).
    *   **Instrument Editor:** A screenshot of the FM instrument editor (showing Algorithm diagrams) vs. the Wavetable editor (showing the waveform drawing tool).
*   **DefleMask Mobile:** A screenshot of the interface running on an iPad to demonstrate the touch-optimized workflow.
*   **Plogue Chipsynth MD:** A screenshot of the GUI, specifically highlighting the "DAC" or "Ladder Effect" visualization if available, or the Algorithm selector.
*   **LSDj:** A screenshot of the "Table" screen and the "Song" screen, emphasizing the Game Boy's limited screen real estate.

## 2. Technical Diagrams (Hardware Engineering)
*   **FM Algorithm Chart:** A clean, simplified vector diagram showing the 8 Algorithms of the YM2612 (Operators connecting to Operators vs. Operators connecting to Output).
*   **Signal Flow: Subtractive vs. FM:** A comparison diagram.
    *   *Subtractive:* Oscillator -> Filter -> Amp.
    *   *FM:* Modulator -> Carrier -> Output.
*   **The "Ladder Effect" Visualized:** A waveform graph showing a smooth sine wave vs. a sine wave with "crossover distortion" (flattening at the zero crossing) to visualize the "Grit."
*   **Gaussian Interpolation:** A frequency response graph showing the roll-off curve of the SNES filter vs. a raw sample.

## 3. Music Theory Visuals
*   **The Royal Road Map:** A circular or flow-chart diagram visualizing the **IV -> V -> iii -> vi** progression, highlighting the "Lift," "Climb," "Detour," and "Landing" stages.
*   **Piano Roll vs. Tracker:** A side-by-side comparison of a simple melody (e.g., Mario Theme) displayed in a Piano Roll (DAW) and a Tracker (Hex) to help DAW users translate the concepts.
*   **Quartal Harmony Stacks:** A notation snippet (or Piano Roll view) showing a standard Tertian chord (C-E-G) vs. a Quartal chord (C-F-Bb) to illustrate the "open" voicing.

## 4. Hardware Photos (Optional but Recommended)
*   **The Chips:** High-quality macro photography of the Ricoh 2A03, Yamaha YM2612, and Sony SPC700 dies (if licensable) or packages.
*   **The Consoles:** Clean product shots of the Genesis Model 1, SNES, and Game Boy (DMG-01).
